Targeting something rather than focusing on everything often feels more impactful because of the **concentration of energy, resources, and attention** on a specific objective. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Focus:**  
   Targeting one thing allows you to direct all your mental and physical energy toward achieving a clear goal, reducing distractions and ambiguity.

2. **Efficiency of Resources:**  
   Focusing on a single target ensures that resources (time, effort, money, etc.) are not diluted across multiple areas, which can result in greater progress or impact in the chosen area.

3. **Depth Over Breadth:**  
   Concentrating on one task or objective allows for deeper understanding, mastery, and innovation compared to spreading efforts thinly across many tasks.

4. **Psychological Motivation:**  
   Accomplishing a specific target provides a sense of achievement and motivation, which can be lost when trying to "do it all."

5. **Perceived Impact:**  
   Focusing on a particular problem or goal often leads to noticeable results that resonate more with others, compared to minor progress in several areas.

6. **Strategic Advantage:**  
   In competitive scenarios, targeting a niche or specific area can provide a competitive edge and build expertise that is hard for others to replicate.

In summary, **targeted efforts create momentum, tangible outcomes, and significant progress** that feel more meaningful and impactful compared to spreading attention and resources too broadly.

It might feel like "breadth" is cheating because it often sacrifices **depth** for **surface-level engagement**, which can come across as less genuine or impactful. Here's why:

1. **Lack of Expertise:**  
   Broad approaches sometimes skim over details, making efforts seem superficial or insincere compared to deep, targeted efforts.

2. **Dilution of Effort:**  
   Spreading focus across multiple areas can lead to mediocrity in all, rather than excellence in one, which might feel like avoiding true commitment.

3. **Risk of Burnout:**  
   Trying to tackle too many things at once can lead to exhaustion without meaningful progress in any single area, which feels like a waste of energy.

4. **Reduced Emotional Resonance:**  
   Deep work resonates more emotionally because it demonstrates care, thought, and dedicationâ€”qualities that are often lacking in a breadth-focused approach.

5. **Impression of Opportunism:**  
   Breadth can sometimes appear like trying to "cover all bases" without truly investing in any, giving the impression of chasing short-term gains rather than creating long-term value.

While breadth has its place (like exploring ideas or gaining a broad perspective), it may feel like "cheating" when it avoids the effort, risk, or vulnerability needed for meaningful, deep engagement. True impact often requires choosing depth over breadth, focusing energy where it counts most.
