The phenomenon you’re describing is a **cognitive bias** where individuals believe that their assumptions or perceptions are valid enough to accuse others of the same. This could be linked to several psychological and sociological concepts:

---

### 1. **Projection Bias**  
   - **Definition:** People assume that others share their beliefs, emotions, or assumptions.
   - **Example:** If you think someone dislikes you, you might accuse them of acting based on that assumption, even if they haven’t shown evidence of such feelings.

---

### 2. **Fundamental Attribution Error**  
   - **Definition:** People attribute others' behavior to internal factors (like assumptions or beliefs) rather than external circumstances.
   - **Example:** Assuming someone made a mistake because of poor judgment rather than understanding their circumstances.

---

### 3. **Egocentric Bias**  
   - **Definition:** Overestimating how much others share your perspectives, thoughts, or feelings.
   - **Example:** Thinking, "If I assume this, everyone else must assume the same."

---

### 4. **Confirmation Bias**  
   - **Definition:** Interpreting others' actions or beliefs in a way that confirms your own assumptions or preconceptions.
   - **Example:** Accusing others based on assumptions you’ve already decided are true.

---

### 5. **Self-Justification and Moral Licensing**  
   - **Definition:** Believing it’s acceptable to judge others based on personal assumptions because you feel morally or intellectually justified.
   - **Example:** "If I think it, it must be reasonable to assume they think it too."

This phenomenon often arises from **lack of evidence** or a desire to control narratives. It can lead to misunderstandings and conflict because it bypasses direct communication or proof.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this applies to specific situations?
