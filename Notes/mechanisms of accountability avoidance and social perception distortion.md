Diffusion of Responsibility: This happens when someone avoids accountability or feels less responsible because others are involved. For example, they might think, "It's not my fault because someone else assumes responsibility or takes the blame."

Disassociation: This is a psychological mechanism where a person detaches themselves from their own actions or identity. They may think, "It's not me; it’s someone else’s issue or assumption."

Cognitive Dissonance: The discomfort that arises when their actions or beliefs contradict their identity, leading them to shift responsibility or blame to align with their self-perception.

Projection: A defense mechanism where someone attributes their own thoughts, feelings, or behaviors to others, thinking, "It’s not me; it’s them."

Plausible Deniability: The person continues their actions but feels justified because someone else's assumptions provide them with a way to deny responsibility. They think, "If others assume it, then I can act without owning up to it."

Self-Justification through Assumption: This is when someone rationalizes their behavior because someone else's assumptions make it seem acceptable. They feel, "Since they think it’s this way, I might as well act as if it is."

Social Confirmation Bias: When a person modifies their behavior or justifies it because others' beliefs or assumptions indirectly validate it.

Projection: The person shifts responsibility or guilt for their own actions onto someone else, thinking, "I'll just say they did it so I don’t have to take accountability."

Gaslighting: By denying their involvement and attributing the action to someone else, they may attempt to manipulate others into questioning the reality of who is responsible.

False Attribution: This is when someone deliberately credits or blames someone else for an action they did themselves, either to reject responsibility or to diminish the other's credibility or achievements.

Deflection: Instead of addressing their accountability, they steer attention away from themselves by placing it on someone else, saying, "They did it," to avoid consequences or to downplay their role.

Presumptive Guilt: This occurs when others make assumptions about your intentions or actions without evidence. When you speak out to clarify, they claim they "got you," implying they had already judged you based on their assumptions.

False Presumption of Intent: Others assume you were about to do something (even if you weren't), and when you vocalize or act defensively, they interpret it as confirmation of their incorrect assumptions.

Defensive Projection: This happens when someone attributes their own thoughts or suspicions to you, framing it as if they "knew" what you were thinking or planning to do, even though it's based on their biases.

Self-Fulfilling Misunderstanding: When their assumptions provoke you to react, and they then use your reaction as evidence to justify their initial false assumption, reinforcing a misunderstanding.
