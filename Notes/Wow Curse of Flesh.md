In the game's narrative, the titans created various races, such as the earthen (progenitors of dwarves), mechagnomes (ancestors of gnomes), and vrykul (forebears of humans), to shape and maintain Azeroth. Yogg-Saron, seeking to weaken these defenses, corrupted the Forge of Wills, a titan device responsible for creating new titan-forged. This corruption introduced the Curse of Flesh, causing these beings to become susceptible to mortality and other vulnerabilities. citeturn0search1

The transformation had profound implications:

- **Earthen to Dwarves**: The earthen, initially stone-like beings, transformed into the flesh-and-blood dwarves. citeturn0search3

- **Mechagnomes to Gnomes**: Mechanical mechagnomes became the gnomes known today. citeturn0search3

- **Vrykul to Humans**: The vrykul experienced changes leading to the emergence of humans. citeturn0search3

This curse not only altered physical forms but also introduced emotions and free will, leading to the development of diverse cultures and societies among these races. While the Curse of Flesh made these beings more vulnerable, it also endowed them with qualities like courage and resilience, enabling them to confront threats, including the Old Gods themselves. citeturn0search3
