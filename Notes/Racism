Intentional and subconscious (or implicit) racism describe two different ways that racial bias and discrimination can occur:

1. **Intentional (Conscious) Racism**: This form of racism is deliberate, where the individual is fully aware of their prejudiced beliefs or discriminatory actions. Intentional racism is often motivated by overt biases, stereotypes, or a belief in racial superiority or inferiority. Examples include openly derogatory comments, exclusion based on race, or purposeful discrimination in hiring, housing, and other areas.

2. **Subconscious (Implicit) Racism**: This type of racism occurs without conscious intent or awareness. Implicit biases are the automatic stereotypes or prejudices that affect our behavior and judgments, often without us realizing it. This can manifest in subtle ways, such as favoring one group over another in ambiguous situations or harboring negative associations about certain races that influence decision-making unconsciously. For example, a teacher might unknowingly have lower expectations for students of a certain race, or a hiring manager may unknowingly lean toward candidates who look more like themselves.

### Key Differences
- **Awareness**: Intentional racism is conscious, whereas implicit racism is subconscious and often unknown to the person holding the bias.
- **Behavior**: Intentional racism often involves overt actions or statements, while subconscious racism can appear in subtle actions or attitudes that might be unintentional but still harmful.
- **Motivation**: Intentional racism is driven by explicit prejudices, while subconscious racism is usually driven by internalized cultural stereotypes or societal norms.

### Addressing Both Forms
Reducing intentional racism often involves clear policies, accountability, and education on why such beliefs are harmful. Addressing subconscious racism requires awareness-building through training on implicit biases, self-reflection, and creating systems that minimize opportunities for biases to influence decisions (e.g., standardized hiring processes, blind recruitment).

Both forms of racism have significant impacts, and addressing both is crucial for building equitable and inclusive environments.
