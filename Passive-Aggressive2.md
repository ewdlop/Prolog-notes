Let’s expand on **Passive-Aggressive Prolog** with more intricate scenarios and layers of implied irritation. Here's the updated, *snark-loaded* code:

```prolog
% Facts: everyone's preferences and quirks, as if we needed to know.
likes(john, tea).          % John and his precious tea. How fascinating.
likes(mary, coffee).        % Coffee, Mary? Because that's *so* revolutionary.
likes(susan, matcha).       % Matcha, Susan? We get it—you’re trendy.
likes(james, tea).          % James, copying John with tea. Original.
likes(karen, nothing).      % Karen refuses to like anything, naturally.
dislikes(amy, tea).         % Amy dislikes tea. Oh, the drama.

% Additional quirks
introvert(susan).           % Susan needs matcha to tolerate socializing, of course.
extrovert(mary).            % Mary drinks coffee and talks everyone’s ears off.
indecisive(james).          % James can’t even decide what to drink half the time.

% Rules: because life is all about rules, right?
compatible(X, Y) :-
    likes(X, Z), likes(Y, Z), X \= Y, 
    write('Oh, '), write(X), write(' and '), write(Y),
    write(' like the same thing ('), write(Z), write('). What a coincidence.\n').

social_clash(X, Y) :-
    introvert(X), extrovert(Y),
    write('Well, '), write(X), write(' is an introvert and '), write(Y), 
    write(' is an extrovert. Good luck making that work.\n').

drink_conflict(X, Y) :-
    dislikes(X, Z), likes(Y, Z),
    write(X), write(' absolutely hates '), write(Z), 
    write(', but guess what? '), write(Y), write(' loves it. Awkward.\n').

undecided(X) :-
    indecisive(X),
    write(X), write(' can’t make a decision, as always. Typical.\n').

picky(X) :-
    likes(X, nothing),
    write(X), write(' likes nothing at all. How charmingly impossible.\n').

% More specific queries, because people always need to dig deeper:
likes_same_thing(X, Y) :-
    likes(X, Z), likes(Y, Z), X \= Y,
    write(X), write(' and '), write(Y), write(' share the same taste in '), write(Z), 
    write('. It’s almost like they planned it.\n').

everyone_dislikes(Z) :-
    \+ (likes(_, Z)),
    write('Nobody likes '), write(Z), write('. Wow, shocking.\n').

% Queries: the world is dying to know, aren’t they?
% ?- compatible(john, james). % John and James bonding over tea. Adorable.
% ?- social_clash(susan, mary). % Like Susan could handle Mary’s extroverted energy.
% ?- drink_conflict(amy, john). % Amy versus John: tea wars incoming.
% ?- undecided(james). % James is still thinking. Surprise, surprise.
% ?- picky(karen). % Oh, Karen doesn’t like anything? Color me surprised.
% ?- likes_same_thing(susan, james). % Bonding over matcha, because why not?
% ?- everyone_dislikes(kombucha). % Oh, kombucha. The neglected child of beverages.
```

### **What's New?**

1. **Deeper Social Commentary**:
   - `social_clash/2`: Introduces personality dynamics like introvert/extrovert tension.
   - `drink_conflict/2`: Highlights potential drama when someone dislikes what another loves.

2. **Sarcastic Edge on Behaviors**:
   - `undecided/1`: Mocks indecisive individuals.
   - `picky/1`: Relentlessly points out the impossibility of dealing with someone who likes nothing.

3. **Additional Queries**:
   - `likes_same_thing/2`: Finds people with shared preferences, implying suspicious collusion.
   - `everyone_dislikes/1`: Unveils universally hated items, complete with sarcastic surprise.

This setup allows for endless possibilities in creating new rules or adding more complex characters with even more exaggerated quirks. Let me know if you'd like another layer of **snark-enhanced logic**!
