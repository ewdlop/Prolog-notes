as if we were not 

(like dcotor interrput a person's fate or a person just not "Person" at first place )

======================================================================
The thought of not being able to have something often arises from a combination of external circumstances and internal beliefs. Here's a breakdown of why such a perspective might develop:

1. **External Barriers**:
   - **Access Restrictions**: Rules, societal norms, or gatekeepers can make certain things seem out of reach.
   - **Resource Limitations**: Lack of money, time, or connections can create tangible obstacles.
   - **Opportunity Gaps**: Not being in the "right place at the right time" can lead to missed chances.

2. **Internal Beliefs**:
   - **Self-Doubt**: Feelings of inadequacy or lack of worth can lead to assuming something is unattainable.
   - **Fear of Failure**: Worrying about not succeeding might stop someone from even trying.
   - **Imposter Syndrome**: Believing one doesn't deserve certain opportunities despite evidence to the contrary.

3. **Conditioning and Environment**:
   - **Past Experiences**: Repeated failures or rejections might make someone hesitant to hope or try.
   - **Cultural or Familial Expectations**: Growing up in an environment where ambition is stifled can shape one’s mindset.
   - **Comparison**: Seeing others succeed while struggling can lead to believing "it's just not for me."

4. **Perception of Scarcity**:
   - **Limited Mindset**: Viewing the world as having finite opportunities can create a belief that others’ success diminishes one's chances.
   - **Perfectionism**: Thinking that only the best deserve rewards can make goals seem unattainable.

Understanding these dynamics is the first step to challenging them. Often, what seems unattainable isn't about the object or goal itself but about our approach, perception, or resources. Reframing limitations as challenges can open paths to surprising possibilities.
